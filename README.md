## Instructions
1. Run skellyboi.exe
2. Enter a threshold amount
3. Add new browser overlay in obs with the address 127.0.0.1:5000

NOTE: Threshold can only be entered on startup. A higher threshold will make the animation less sensitive to sound (only play for louder sounds). Numbers shown in the console are the current audio level. Threshold should be based off those numbers.
